# vibe-summoner
Help musicians summon whatever vibez they want - live. Then export it straight to Ableton for post-production / finalization.

## MVP Outline
- Electron app
- Single button called "KICK" that plays a sick loud kick sound
- No need to "load" your songs into VibeSummoner. To start jamming, simply hit play on your Spotify / Youtube.
- Ability to live record everything that your computer is playing in the moment - including the KICK - and to export it out as separate audio tracks. One audio track per app or instrument playing something (Spotify / Youtube / KICK / etc).

## Post MVP Roadmap
- Auto Fade out / Fade in to change songs
- Add more buttons and allow them to be customized w/ any sound you want, so musicians can create their own "live set" for each occasion
- Allow sounds to be grabbed from anywhere in your computer as easily as possible. Found a sound you like on YouTube, Splice, Spotify, or anywhere else? You should be able to "hook" that sound to a button on your live set
- Add a single microphone to record all live instruments and musicians that are helping compose the vibe outside the computer
- Export your multi-track recorded live sessions straight into Ableton and other famous DAWs for post-production
