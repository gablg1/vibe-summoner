# vibe-summoner
Help musicians summon whatever vibez they want - live. Then export it straight to Ableton for post-production / finalization.

## MVP Outline
- Electron app
- Single button called "KICK" that plays a sick loud kick sound
- No need to "load" your songs into VibeSummoner. To start jamming, simply hit play on your Spotify / Youtube.
- Ability to live record everything that your computer is playing in the moment - including the KICK - and to export it out as separate audio tracks. One audio track per app or instrument playing something (Spotify / Youtube / KICK / etc).

## Post MVP Roadmap
- Add percussion loops to any live sound
- Auto Fade out / Fade in to change songs
- Add more buttons and allow them to be customized w/ any sound you want, so musicians can create their own "live set" for each occasion
- Allow sounds to be grabbed from anywhere in your computer as easily as possible. Found a sound you like on YouTube, Splice, Spotify, or anywhere else? You should be able to "hook" that sound to a button on your live set
- Add a single microphone to record all live instruments and musicians that are helping compose the vibe outside the computer
- Export your multi-track recorded live sessions straight into Ableton and other famous DAWs for post-production
- Mobile app

## Create React App Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
